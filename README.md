Hi! My name is Gabriel da Silva Marques and I'm a student from SÃ£o Paulo Brazil! I'm extremely passionate about technology ðŸ¤– (particularly robotics) and I create this account to keep record of my personal projects 
and ideas. I want to use my projects not just to understand how to produce new technology, but also to cause a positive impact in my community. I hope you guys like my journey here ðŸ«¶
